# chi_test_sample
this is a chi test on the open credit lines column of the lending club data 

if the p value is greater > .05 then HO is true, thus, the data is evenly distributed. because the test statistics is 2408.43314652 and the p value is 0.0, the opposite of the hypothesis is true
and the data is not normally distributed. in fact, the data is skewed right.
